# Thesis-Squinvoice

Thesis project illustrating how a centralized system for exchanging invoices data with a standard formtat might help companies in the accounting processes.

Nowadays most of the countries have electronic systems for e-invoices without being able to merge them into one single format which causes the most issues.

With the implemented service, which is not meant to replace the existing solution but simply provide a service on top of it, companies would be able to easily share such information with no impact on their actual processes.
